# Powerfit-Manager
This repository contains the code of the management system for part of the processes that the Powerfit gym covers

MySQL is used as a database manager, and React js as a JavaScript framework for all entire web development.

easy instructions for develop init: 

1. Clone project.
2. install node js and MySQL manager.
3. The project is divided into two parts: client (react js) and server (express js with connection to MySQL.
4. you need to run npm install, then npm start into root client and same steps with the server, but instead of run npm start, run "nodemon" as a command, to start serve.
5. you need to run DB_DUMP.sql, file located in SQL folder (in the project) in your MySQL database manager (I recommend to you install MySQL workbench or whatever you prefer, it's ok). 
6. you might run credentials file too (BD_USER_CONFIG.sql) located in SQL folder too. because that credentials will be used in the express js server, required to succeed MySQL connection.
7. the system it's already to use and codeeee! :)
